						<h3 id="h3">1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3><br>
						<p id="p3"> Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the
							lather to
							your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an
							antibacterial and antiviral soap.<br>
							Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several
						times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop. </p>

							SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your
							hands if you touch a surface like:
							gas pump handle
							your cell phone
							a doorknob
							Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also
							avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands
							into your body.

						<h3 id="h6">3. Take physical (social) distancing seriously</h3><br>
						<p id="p2"> If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your
							spit
							(sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms.
							Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when
							possible.
							If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people.
						You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you. </p>

						<h3 id="h7">4. Wear a (homemade) mask</h3><br>
						<p id="p2"> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendsTrusted Source
							that almost everyone wears a cloth face mask in public settings where physical
							distancing may be difficult, such as grocery stores.
							When used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or
							undiagnosed from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 when they breathe, talk, sneeze, or cough.
						This, in turn, slows the transmission of the virus. </p>

						<h3 id="h8">5. Stay Physically Fit</h3><br>
						<p id="p2">Perhaps the most obvious advice on this list is to stay fit by regularly working
							out. The trick to staying motivated with your workouts is to pick a sport or exercise
							that you find entertaining. Do something you can lose yourself in and that makes you
							feel better.
							The recommended average is about 30 mins a day, every day of the week for most people.
							WHO says this is the minimum amount of moderate exercise needed to maintain your level
							of fitness. You may need to go over this if you want to achieve some goals, such as
							losing weight or building muscles. The choice of exercise is up to you, but make sure
							you have some supervision while attempting more advanced forms of exercise such as yoga
						or cross fit. </p>
