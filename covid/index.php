                                                        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
                                                        informed about
                                                        the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and
                                                        others from
                                                        infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing
                                                        a properly
                                                        fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based
                                                        rub frequently.
                                                        Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

                                                        The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in
                                                        small liquid
                                                        particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These
                                                        particles range
                                                        from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is
                                                        important to
                                                        practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a
                                                        flexed elbow, and
                                                        to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel
                                                        unwell.<br />

                                            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to

                                            Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill

                                            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be

                                            about
                                            the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and

                                            (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza

                                            should you call your primary care provider to obtain a test?<br><br>

                                Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several

                                SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your
                                hands if you touch a surface like:

                                gas pump handle
                                your cell phone

                                Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also
                                avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands
                                into your body.

                                (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms.

                                Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when
                                possible.

                                If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people.
                                You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you. </p>

                                that almost everyone wears a cloth face mask in public settings where physical
                                distancing may be difficult, such as grocery stores.

                                When used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or
                                undiagnosed from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 when they breathe, talk, sneeze, or cough.
                                This, in turn, slows the transmission of the virus. </p>

                            <p id="p2">Perhaps the most obvious advice on this list is to stay fit by regularly working
                                out. The trick to staying motivated with your workouts is to pick a sport or exercise
                                that you find entertaining. Do something you can lose yourself in and that makes you
                                feel better.

                                The recommended average is about 30 mins a day, every day of the week for most people.
                                WHO says this is the minimum amount of moderate exercise needed to maintain your level
                                of fitness. You may need to go over this if you want to achieve some goals, such as
                                losing weight or building muscles. The choice of exercise is up to you, but make sure
                                you have some supervision while attempting more advanced forms of exercise such as yoga
                                or cross fit. </p>
