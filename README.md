# How Project Works

Firstly in this project we are asking the user to register on the website, this data will be stored in backend then the user with same email address
and password can login to the website. As user enter in home page, there will be some tabs like information about covid-19,precautions,symptoms of covid-19.
We have taken the information of user like their addhar number,vaccine name,date of vaccine,etc this will be stored and after successful completion of their
vaccination, the user can download their certificate from "My Profile Page".
Now, on "My Profile Page" we have perform operations like UPDATE, DELETE & VIEW CERTIFICATE.The person can see their entered details,they can update details &
can download their certificate.
