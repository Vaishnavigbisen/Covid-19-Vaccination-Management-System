                            symptoms,fever,cough,shortness
                            of

                            In more severe cases,infection can cause pneumonia,severe
                            acute respiratory
                            syndrome,Kidney failure and even death.<br><br>
                            Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
                            regular hand
                            washing,covering mouth and nose when coughing and

                            illness such as coughing and sneezing.<br><br><br><br><br>
                            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to
                            moderate
                            respiratory
                            illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
                            However, some will
                            become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older
                            people and those
                            with
                            underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,
                            diabetes, chronic
                            respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop
                            serious illness.
                            Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill
                            or die at any
                            age.<br /><br>
                            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be
                            well informed
                            about
                            the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and
                            others from
                            infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others,
                            wearing a properly
                            fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an
                            alcohol-based rub
                            frequently.<br><br>
                            Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local
                            guidance.
                            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose
                            in small liquid
                            particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.
                            These particles
                            range<br><br>
                            from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is
                            important to
                            practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into
                            a flexed elbow,
                            and<br><br>
                            to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel
                            unwell.<br>
                            Most people infected with the virus will experience
                            mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
                            requiring
                            special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill
                            and require
                            medical attention. Older people and those with underlying
                            medical
                            conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
                            respiratory
                            disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
                            illness. Anyone
                            can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die
                            at any
                            age.<br />
