                                ** Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses,
                                but
                                they
                                are
                                caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new
                                coronavirus
                                (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza
                                viruses.<br><br>
                                ** COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious
                                illnesses
                                in
                                some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people
                                can
                                be
                                contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and
                                COVID-19
                                is available in the different sections below.<br><br>
                                ** Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be
                                hard
                                to
                                tell
                                the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be
                                needed
                                to
                                help confirm a diagnosis.<br><br>
                                ** While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes
                                it,
                                there
                                is still a lot that is unknown . This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given

                                available information to date.<br><br>
                                ** As colder fall air sets in and flu season inches closer, it's a question
                                that
                                many

                                Since the beginning of the pandemic, testing has become more readily
                                available
                                so
                                more people are able to be tested for the virus. But at the first sign of a
                                sniffle,
                                should you call your primary care provider to obtain a test?<br><br>
                                To ensure that testing continues to be available for those at the highest
                                risk,
                                make
                                sure you know the difference between symptoms of COVID-19, the common cold
                                and
                                the
